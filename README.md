   cd construction_equip
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**:
   Run this from the root directory to install packages for root, client, and server:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/construction_equip
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Seed the Database (Optional but Recommended)**:
   To populate the database with sample construction products, brands, and categories:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node seed.js
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   From the root directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will run both the frontend (localhost:3000) and backend (localhost:5000) concurrently.

## 🔹 PROJECT STRUCTURE
- `server/`: Express backend with MongoDB models, API controllers, and routes.
- `client/`: React frontend with Redux state management and Tailwind styling.
- `uploads/`: Directory for stored product images.

## 🔹 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
The platform uses a clean, light-themed color palette (white, light grey, soft blue, beige, light yellow) to maintain a professional and minimal design suitable for the construction industry, mirroring the layout and robust user experience of Amazon.com. It incorporates smooth micro-interactions, responsive design, and intuitive navigation.
